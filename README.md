# discord-games

A discord bot to play interactive games.
It currently supports the following games:
 - Wordle
 - 2048

## Usage

To use the bot yourself, you'll need to set a channel for the bot to send its images to.
This is defined by the `:img-channel` value in the config.edn

The bot expects your discord oauth token as an environment variable with the name `DISCORD_GAMES_TOKEN`, so if your token is `asdf` you can just run the bot with `DISCORD_GAMES_TOKEN="asdf" lein run`

The prefix for commands can be changed in the config.edn, it's `$` by default

## Commands

The bot currently has the following commands:
 - $2048 will start a new 2048 game
 - $wordle \<guess\> will start a new wordle game
 - $quit \<game\> will quit your current session for \<game\>
